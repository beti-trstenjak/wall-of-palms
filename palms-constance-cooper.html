        <h3>"PALMS" BY CONSTANCE COOPER</h3>

    <div class="palms-description">
            <p>
                The sound file “Palms” is made up of music bits played only by the palms — no fingers — using electric 
                piano and synthesizer sounds that were then computer-processed. The sounds include some melody, some 
                up-and-down swooping, drumbeats, lots of clanks and clonks suggesting old machinery, and hisses that 
                are like old apartment heating systems in New York — still audible in many buildings.
            </p>

            <p>
                The music, imitating people straying around in a gallery, goes from one phrase to the next without much 
                transition. So this piece is the artist's “Pictures at an Exhibition” but with no march-like ("promenade") music between paintings 
                in the famous Mussorgsky work of that title.
            </p>
